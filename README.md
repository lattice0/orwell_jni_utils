# Orwell JNI Utils
Some jni utils that I open sourced. It's a sketch, and maybe someone will clean it. I'm not using right now as I moved my code to Rust, but I intend to make this header file grow. Maybe all the functions should accept `std::optional` by default instead of pointers, for better error handling. 

Please PR!
